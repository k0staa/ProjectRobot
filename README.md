## ProjectRobot

Aim of this project is to create robot with use of Raspberry Pi 2 and 
following items/functionalities:
- 2 DC motors (with wheels)
- Ultrasonic distance sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Nokia 5100 lcd 
- Wi-fi or RF 
- Camera streaming
- Voice Synth
- Voice control

I will try to apply some machine learning to robot after connecting all necessary modules and electronic equipment.
